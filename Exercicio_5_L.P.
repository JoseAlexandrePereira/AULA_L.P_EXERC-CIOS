Read three values (variables A, B and C), which are the three student's grades. Then, calculate the average, considering that grade A has weight 2, grade B has weight 3 and the grade C has weight 5. Consider that each grade can go from 0 to 10.0, always with one decimal place.

Input
The input file contains 3 values of floating points (double) with one digit after the decimal point.

Output
Print the message "MEDIA"(average in Portuguese) and the student's average according to the following example, with a blank space before and after the equal signal.
